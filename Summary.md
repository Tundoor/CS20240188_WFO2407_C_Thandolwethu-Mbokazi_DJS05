## How to Run code

In order to run the code you will need to subscribe to the store. Once subscribed when an action is dispatched it will notify you of the change of the state. You can also run the code by using the getstate() method to get the current state of the store.

## Approach to project

When doing this project I started by watching the videos which were provided to us on the lms and then I started by creating the reducer functions increment, decrement and reset. From there I used console.log to check they are working and then I moved on to creating the actions and the store. After that I used the subscribe method to subscribe.

## Challenges I faced.

Some of the challenges which I faced while creating this was finding resourses other than hose provided to us to get a more in depth understanding of the challenge.
